### Experiment description
Run YCSB-E workload on KVell.
Each experiment is run 5 times.

Interrupt schemes under comparison: cint, default, adaptive.

**Make sure you have run the `build-kvell.sh` script in the top-level directory!**

### Description of scripts in this directory
* run.sh		-- script to run the scan benchmark (YCSB-E) of KVell, for scan lengths 16 and 256
* parse.sh	-- script to generate the CDF of scan latencies (Fig 17) for scans of length 16 and 256, as well as scan throughput (Table 5)
* makeall.sh	-- run the two preceding scripts

### NOTES (potential manual intervention required)
* cdf.sh -- you might need to manually toggle the bucket size of the histogram by uncommenting and manually setting the bucket size in line 36 and 38 of cdf.sh
* fig17.gp -- you might need to change the x-axis ranges and tic intervals to match the histogram ranges generated by cdf.sh. This would be lines 62,64,94,104 in fig17.gp.

Please reach out to us if you need help with this manual intervention.

### Output files
* thru16.out,thru256.out		-- data that shows up in Table 5 in the paper
* fig17.pdf			-- CDF of latencies, Figure 17 in the paper
